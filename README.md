# Timbre classification based on the supervised classification

About
-----
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is a field of study focused on extraction and inference of significant features in a given sound. 
This area is very important for the implementation of search, recommendation and data recovery, for example: the search for a particular song in a large dataset; recommendation music on systems like Spotify and Youtube, and even the detection of commands provided through the voice, such as Cortana, from Windows. In this way, the MIR becomes a area of ​​interest, presenting interdisciplinary characteristics involving sub-areas of computing, such as musical computing and machine learning, and also areas like math and music.

In this way, the objective of this work is the development of a system tone classification system to automatically distinguish the sound produced by a guitar and a bass.
It is worth mentioning that more relevant than the application itself, studies of sound properties are presented, of the techniques used to extract them efficiently and how to classify them based on the combination of of audio descriptors and learning algorithms for machine.

There are 5 algorithms of classification here:
* Naive bayes implemented by me;
* Naive bayes by sklearn;
* Decision tree;
* svc;
* and a multiclassifier mixing 3 of them, based on voting system.

Data base for training the guitar and basses samples is the NSynth Dataset, used with 2500 samples of each class.
